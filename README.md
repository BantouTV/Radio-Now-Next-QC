Now Next Quartz Composition
===========================

A Quartz Composer composition that rolls through the BBC's National Radio networks and displays who is currently on air, as well as downloading and displaying the network logo and a pretty image for that show. 

Requirements
------------

* Make sure you are running Mac OSX 10.6 (It won't work otherwise)


Have a play
-----------

The main BBC Radio Now.qtz file will open in your local copy of [Quartz Composer](http://developer.apple.com/graphicsimaging/quartz/quartzcomposer.html), where you can tinker with all the settings.

Run as Screensaver
------------------

To install as a screensaver, you need to:

* Download and Unzip the [lastest version](http://github.com/bbcrd/Radio-Now-Next-QC/downloads) 
* Move the BBC Radio Now.qtz file into your Screen Savers directory `/Users/<username>/Library/Screen Savers`
* NOTE: You may need to create the Screen Savers directory if it doesn't exist
